# U.S. Web Design Standards WordPress Theme

This WordPress starter theme uses the [U.S. Web Design Standards] (v.0.8.2) created by [U.S. Digital Service] and [18F].

The `master` branch of this repo contains the most basic integration of the U.S. Web Design Standards with a WordPress theme. _**Fork it, develop it, & share your code!**_

The `sage` and `_s` branches integrate the standards with two popular WordPress theme frameworks, [Sage] and [_s] (or "underscores"). _**Again: Fork, develop, & share your code!**_

New branches will build towards a robust WordPress starter theme that integrates the U.S. Web Design Standards with modern technologies and the best practices of the WordPress theme ecosystem.

## Contribute
**Keep it open!** Contribute code and ideas. Fork this repo and integrate the Web Design Standards with your favorite starter theme. Forks that successfully integrate the Web Standards will be branched and active contributors will be made repo collaborators. _**May the best branch become the master!**_

More to come!
